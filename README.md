# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where two players can compete against each other.

## Design Choices and CSS Usage

### Centered Content

To create a visually appealing layout, I centered the game's content both horizontally and vertically on the page. This was achieved by setting the `display: flex` property on the `html` and `body` elements and using `justify-content` and `align-items` to center the content.

### Player Names on Top of Images

I displayed the names of the players (Player 1 and Player 2) on top of their respective images. This was achieved by using a specific HTML structure and applying CSS to style the player names and images accordingly.

### Responsive Design

The game is designed to be responsive to different screen sizes. Relative units like percentages and ems were used for sizing elements to ensure the game adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.
